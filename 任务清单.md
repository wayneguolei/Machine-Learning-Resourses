### Assignments
- [ ] Assignment 1-1
    - [X] understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
    - [X] understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
    - [X] develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy
    - [X] implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
    - [ ] implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
    - [ ] implement and apply a Softmax classifier
    - [ ] implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier
    - [ ] understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
    - [ ] get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color 
    - [ ] histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)
